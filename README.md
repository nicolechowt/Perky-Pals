# Perky Pals
<strong>Perky pals</strong> is a submission for the Girls In Tech hackathon in Fall 2020.

Perky pals is a wellness tracker that continuously motivates you to create and build healthy habits to reduce your overall risks of breast cancer.  We remove barriers to resources by allowing our users to earn points for healthy food, time-saving meals, and pro-bono medical care for reaching their goals. 

Our colors are vibrant to convey energy and positivity. The font is strong and curvy to reflect the women who use the Perky Pals. We write in a voice that is casual and upbeat to connect with women in a positive way, driving good results.

## User Journeys
We organized the results of our analysis into 3 personas and catered the app to solve the pains for these personas.

<strong>Bella</strong> - a new user to the app. She is young, busy and is working multiple jobs to make ends meet. She doesn't feel like she has any extra time in her day to work out.  Her friend Juliana told her about Perky Pals

She comes to the app for tips and and resources to stay motivated with her workouts. She is also intrigued by the rewards like the time-saving meal kits.

Since she is still in her 20s, she has never even thought about breast health.

<strong>Juliana</strong>  - our super user, and Bella's good friend. She has a history in family of breast cancer and is looking for reducing her risk.  Champion for organizing events - Juliana has been earning points for healthy eating, exercise, self checks and scheduling a mammogram. Although she is not in need of the resources herself, she has decided to save her points for a community farm stand with mobile mammogram for an underserved community.

---

<strong>Angie</strong>  - joined Perky Pals because she needed an app to motivate her to workout. With all the recent events in her personal and work life, she has been feeling anxious and having trouble with sleep. She's been wanting to see a therapist for her anxiety but does not have the funds to do so.

She is also aware that she should be getting a mammogram soon due to her age. However, she doesn't even know where to start. Not to mention, she's reluctant to proactively seek information because she's afraid of of the pain and cost.
